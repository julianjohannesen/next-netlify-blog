## What is this?

This blog is a opportunity to record some notes on various web development topics, which I'll be reviewing in the coming months. 

In the wake of the pandemic/quarantine/public school closures, I set aside my dev studies in early 2020. At the time, I'd been studying development for about 2 years, and had just lined up a job at EZCater. I'm only now returning to web development, and I need to review much of what I've already learned.
